# Snyk Buildkite Plugin [![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/1d5cd674308d9572db45ebcb52aec5a32fd38b6763c3705b42.svg)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/plugins-snyk)

A Buildkite plugin that runs [Snyk](https://snyk.io) tests in your Buildkite pipelines. The plugin requires a few dependencies install on your agents in order to function:

[Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli)
[snyk-to-html](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-to-html)

Refer to the documentation for these tools to ensure they are installed on your agents before running the plugin. If you are using the [Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/elastic-ci-aws/elastic-ci-stack-overview), you will need to customise the [bootstrap script](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/elastic-ci-aws/elastic-ci-stack-overview) used by the stack.

## Options

These are all the options available to configure this plugin's behaviour.

### Required

#### `scan` (string)

The type of scan that the plugin will perform. Currently supported options are `oss`, `code`, `container`. (default: `oss`)

### Optional

#### `token-env` (string)
The environment variable the plugin will reference to set `SNYK_TOKEN`. (default: `SNYK_TOKEN`)

#### `org` (string)
Your Snyk Organization slug, sets `SNYK_CFG_ORG`.

#### `image` (string)
The image and tag (example: `alpine:latest`) to pass to the container scan tool.

#### `annotate` (bool)
Annotate the build according to the scan results. If set to `false`, no annotation will be created even if vulnerabilities are detected. (default: `false`)

#### `block` (bool)
Optionally block the build on vulnerability detection.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using the plugin to scan within your Buildkite pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "ðŸ”Ž Scanning with Snyk"
    command: "test.sh"
    plugins:
      - snyk#v0.2.0:
          scan: 'oss'
          annotate: true
```

### And with other options as well:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "ðŸ”Ž Scanning code with Snyk"
    command: "test.sh"
    plugins:
      - snyk#v0.2.0:
          scan: 'code'
          annotate: true
```

Scanning a docker container image by image name and tag:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "ðŸ”Ž Scanning container image with Snyk"
    command: "build.sh"
    plugins:
      - snyk#v0.2.0:
          scan: 'container'
          annotate: true
          image: 'alpine:latest'
```

Block a build when a vulnerability is detected:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "ðŸ”Ž Blocking snyk scan"
    command: "test.sh"
    plugins:
      - snyk#v0.2.0:
          scan: 'oss'
          annotate: true
          block: true
```
